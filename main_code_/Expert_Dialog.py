## Expert Dialog

Now the true fun begins, each wikipedia writer is primed to role-play using the perspectives presented above. It will ask a series of questions of a second "domain expert" with access to a search engine. This generate content to generate a refined outline as well as an updated index of reference documents.


### Interview State

The conversation is cyclic, so we will construct it within its own graph. The State will contain messages, the reference docs, and the editor (with its own "persona") to make it easy to parallelize these conversations.
